## **Release**  
Because mp4 videos are limited to 100mb, the demo video we sent in the form had to be compressed, the **480p quality is not good**.  
We uploaded this **720p video** to YouTube at **23:50 on 7/3**. Hope the judges accept it!

## **Story**  
A **strange fish** (main character) was **caught from the sea** and put into an **aquarium**.  
It needs to **eat everything around it** to grow bigger and return to its old home - **the sea**.  

## **How to play**  
- **Players will play the role of Nemo** - a clown fish, controlled in a **2D environment**, moving with **4 keys W, A, S, D**.  
- **If you encounter a movement error, please switch to Unikey English.**  
- **Eating Mechanics:**  
  - You need to **eat fish with the same level or lower** than you to **gain experience**.  
  - When the **experience bar is full**, your **level will increase by one**, and you can **eat a new fish species**.  
- **Danger:**  
  - **Big fish will eat you** if you are **chased and caught by them**, or you **accidentally stand too close**.  
- **Goal:**  
  - Reach the **ultimate level**, which means you are **at the top of the food chain**.

**Information about folders in Scripts:**

- Framework: contains utility classes such as Singleton, HarmonicOscillation, Timer, SwitchScene, Random. These classes are not specific to this project. They will be used by other classes, or even other projects
- Nemo: contains classes related to the player
- Fish: contains scripts related to the 12 fish species in the game (except the player)
- UI: contains support classes in tasks related to UI-components: color changing animation, zoom in and out animation, input from the player, looping background
- Other: different from Framework, the classes in this folder are still very important and specific to this project. It's just that I don't know where to classify them

**Some significant scripts**

### Player.cs  
- Controls the movement of the main character  
- Handles player input (W, S, A, D)  
- Interacts with enemies and the environment:   
- Depends on : Enemy.cs


### Enemy.cs  
- AI for enemies, including random movement and attacks  
- Tracks its distance from the player 
- If the player is nearby. The fish will have one of two reactions: run away if it is weaker than the player or attack the player if it is higher level than the player.
- Depends on: Nemo.cs

### WaveManager.cs
- Control the fish production reasonably
- Fish will be spawned from 2 sides: left and right
- Adjust the appearance rate of fish in the game space. For example: fish that players can eat will have a higher appearance rate
- Depends on the script: Enemy.cs

### GameManager.cs  
- Manages the game state (Start, End)  
- Handles win/lose conditions  
- Manages UI and in-game events  
- Depends/References to all other classes/scripts
